# Design Specifications in Plain Language

## Calendar Screen - Glass and Neumorphic Design

### The Glass Effect (Glassmorphism)

Think of the calendar as if it's made of frosted glass floating above a colored background. Just like real frosted glass:

- You can slightly see through it
- It blurs what's behind it
- It has a soft, ethereal glow
- Light seems to pass through its edges

Key visual elements:

1. The calendar appears to float above the background
2. Each day cell looks like a small piece of glass
3. The edges of the glass have a bright, semi-transparent border
4. The whole effect creates depth without being heavy

### The Buttons (Neumorphic Style)

Picture soft, pillowy buttons that look like they're gently pressed out of or into the surface:

1. Unpressed State:
   
   - Looks like it's rising from the surface
   - Has a light shadow on top and left
   - Has a darker shadow on bottom and right
   - Appears to be "lifted"
   - When you hover, it rises slightly more

2. Pressed State:
   
   - Looks like it's sinking into the surface
   - Shadows reverse: darker inside, lighter outside
   - Gives a satisfying "push" feeling
   - The whole button appears to move down

### The Transparent Border Effect

Around each button and glass element, we create what looks like a completely clear "cut-out" area:

- A thin, completely transparent ring around each element
- Makes it look like the glass was precisely cut
- Creates a floating effect
- Enhances the 3D appearance
- Helps separate elements visually

### Status Colors in Glass

Status indicators (Full Day, Half Day, Off) show through the glass like colored liquid:

- Green (Full Day): soft, mint-like glow
- Yellow (Half Day): gentle, sunny tint
- Red (Off Day): subtle, rose tint
  All colors are very light and semi-transparent, keeping the glass effect intact
